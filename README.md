## Mirror trading hook

The mirror trading hook allows subscribers to replicate the trades of more experienced traders (spot trades within a pre-defined set of pools). This hook enables traders to manage its positions through swaps, while subscribers mirror each trade in real-time.  Subscribers can potentially profit from the trader's expertise, while the trader is incentivized by earning profit fees from the subscribers.

Each trader is defined by the specific pools in which their trades occur and their historical profit and loss (PnL).

Subscribers can join open positions by specifying the amount they wish to mirror and setting take-profit/stop-loss thresholds. They have the flexibility to join or leave open positions at any time.
